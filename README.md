# Phishing Awareness Campaign: Simulated Phishing Education Platform

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create an interactive website or app that simulates phishing attacks to educate users on how to identify and avoid phishing scams. By providing a safe environment for users to experience realistic phishing scenarios, the platform will help them recognize suspicious emails, links, and websites, ultimately reducing the likelihood of falling victim to real-world phishing attacks.

---

## Key Features
### Simulated Phishing Scenarios
- Create realistic phishing emails, fake login pages, and malicious links.
- Include common phishing tactics like urgency, fake sender addresses, and spoofed websites.

### Interactive Learning Modules
- Step-by-step guidance on how to identify phishing attempts.
- Examples of red flags (e.g., misspelled URLs, unsolicited requests for personal information).

### Real-Time Feedback
- Provide immediate feedback when users interact with simulated phishing content.
- Explain why certain elements are suspicious and how to avoid them.

### Progress Tracking
- Track user performance across multiple simulations.
- Provide a score or badge system to encourage engagement.

### Customizable Content
- Allow organizations to tailor phishing scenarios to their industry or specific threats.

### Mobile-Friendly Design
- Ensure the platform is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or Vue.js for dynamic content).
- **Backend**: Python (Django or Flask) for handling user data, tracking progress, and managing simulations.
- **Database**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for storing user profiles and progress.
- **Hosting**: Platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Netlify for deployment.
- **Security**: Implement HTTPS and ensure no real user data is collected or stored.

## Development Steps
1. **Planning and Design**
   - Define the scope of phishing scenarios (e.g., email phishing, SMS phishing, fake websites).
   - Create wireframes for the user interface.

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Build the user interface for the simulations and learning modules.
   - Use JavaScript to create interactive elements (e.g., clicking on links, entering fake credentials).

3. **Backend Development**
   - Develop logic to handle user interactions and track progress.
   - Store user data securely and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.

4. **Content Creation**
   - Write realistic phishing email templates and design fake websites.
   - Develop educational content to explain phishing tactics.

5. **Testing**
   - Test the platform for usability and effectiveness.
   - Ensure the simulations are realistic but not overly complex.

6. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the platform and make it accessible to users.
   - Promote the campaign through email, social media, or internal communication channels.

## Example Workflow
1. **User Registration**
   - Users sign up and complete a brief tutorial on phishing awareness.

2. **Simulation**
   - Users receive a simulated phishing email with a suspicious link.
   - If they click the link, they are directed to a fake login page.

3. **Feedback**
   - If users enter fake credentials, they receive immediate feedback explaining the red flags they missed.
   - If they identify the phishing attempt, they are congratulated and provided with additional tips.

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Users can view their performance dashboard, showing their success rate and areas for improvement.

## Impact
- **Increased Awareness**: Users become more vigilant and confident in identifying phishing attempts.
- **Reduced Risk**: Organizations experience fewer security breaches caused by phishing.
- **Engagement**: Interactive simulations and gamification elements keep users engaged and motivated to learn.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:
**`requirements.txt`**
```plaintext
Flask==2.3.2

## Running the Application

1. Save all files in the correct project structure.
2. Run the Flask app:
 ```bash
   python app.py
3. Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

## How It Works

1. **Homepage:** Users start by visiting the homepage and clicking **"Start Simulation."**
2. **Simulation Page:** Users are presented with a simulated phishing email and two options:
   - **Click the link.**
   - **Ignore the email.**
3. **Feedback Page:**
   - If the user **clicks the link**, they are shown a warning message explaining the risks.
   - If the user **ignores the email**, they are congratulated for making the right choice.
4. **Return to Home:** Users can return to the homepage to restart the simulation.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more phishing scenarios (e.g., fake login pages, SMS phishing).
- Track user progress and scores using a database.
- Implement gamification (e.g., badges, leaderboards).
- Include voice phishing (vishing) and social engineering scenarios.
- Expand the platform to reach a global audience.
- Provide tips on using email filters, antivirus software, and password managers.
